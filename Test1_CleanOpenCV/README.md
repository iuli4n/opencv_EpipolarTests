DESCRIPTION: This is a basic OpenCV project that just loads and displays an image.

BEFORE DURNNING: Visual studio will complain about a DLL not being found. To fix this, go to project properties > Debugging and for the Environment set it to "PATH=$(OPENCV_DIR)\x64\vc14\bin;%PATH%". I don't know why this setting is lost :(((
